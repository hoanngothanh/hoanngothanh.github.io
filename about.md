Hi, my name is Hoan (a male name in my country). I like computers, music, dogs, books, physics, photography and traveling to discover the world. I have no formal college education so if you want to hire me, keep in mind I might not remember the complexity of the radix sort algorithm, but I’m quite good in searching for it. All I learn this way then I use in my projects … I ♥ open source.
 
 Find me on [github](https://github.com/hoanngothanh) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ngothanhhoan).
